# MulticlassSegment

This project focuses on performing multiclass segmentation on images using two different neural network architectures: U-Net and a custom-designed segmentation network. The goal is to accurately segment objects in images into various classes.

## Overview

In this project, I explore two different neural network architectures for multiclass segmentation:

1. U-Net: We implement the classic U-Net architecture, which has proven to be effective for semantic segmentation tasks. U-Net consists of an encoder-decoder structure that captures both local and global features for accurate segmentation.

2. Custom Segmentation Network: Apart from U-Net, I design and implement a custom neural network architecture tailored to the specific multiclass segmentation task. This architecture aims to provide an alternative approach to achieve accurate segmentation results.
